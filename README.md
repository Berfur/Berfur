Hi! You landed on Ruggero's repository, welcome.

I am a recruiter and a tech entusiast.

My interest are mostly office automation (not Ms Office in s√©, but scripting), typhography, writing, and storytelling, so what you will find here is:

* scripting with [Espanso](https://espanso.org/) (mostly), python (not so much)
* [link](./tools.md) to utilities I use (and how to use them efficiently)
* vim and wereabouts

I use both Linux and Windows so my suggestions are mostly for those platforms (I used to script with Autohotkey, and the reason I switched to espanso is because it's multiplatform, Apple included).

More on me here:

* [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruggerofurlanetto/) I am particularly active here for work reasons.
* [Substack](https://recruiters.substack.com/) I write here (**in Italian**) about technology, sociology and humanism

I am particularly interested in dialoge, so I warmly invite you in engaging with me if you find something interesting to discuss upon.
